# CodeQL Advanced Security Analysis for MLXR
# Customized for macOS-native LLM inference engine with MLX framework
#
# Notable customizations:
# - Swift/Objective-C analysis disabled (macOS app incomplete)
# - C++ analysis uses manual build with CMake
# - Path exclusions for generated code and build artifacts
# - Works with GitHub's default setup disabled
